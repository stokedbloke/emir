## Milestone 2: Anonymous User Tracking & Reflection History

### Features
- Each user is assigned a unique anonymous ID (UUID) stored in localStorage.
- Reflections (transcript, summary, emotion, DSP) are saved to Supabase per user.
- Reflection history is loaded from Supabase and shown in the UI.
- No authentication required; user data is private to their browser/device.

### QA/Test Checklist
- [ ] Record and save a reflection; it appears in history.
- [ ] Refresh: history persists for the same user.
- [ ] Multiple reflections are saved and shown in order.
- [ ] Open in incognito or another browser: history is empty (new user).
- [ ] Open in two tabs: history is consistent.
- [ ] Clear browser storage: new user is created.
- [ ] Try with no audio, silence, or noise: app handles gracefully.
- [ ] Simulate Supabase/network failure: app shows error, does not crash.
- [ ] Large/long reflection: app processes and saves without error.
- [ ] Data corruption in DB: app does not crash, handles missing/invalid fields.

**Note:** Some cases (user ID across browsers/devices, storage clearing, etc.) require testing in a deployed (production) environment, not just locally.

## Mobile Testing

### Local Development Testing
To test the app on mobile devices during development:

1. **Same WiFi Network**:
   - Find your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - Access `http://192.168.1.100:3000` on your mobile device
   - Both devices must be on the same WiFi network

2. **ngrok Tunnel** (Recommended for external testing):
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok
   npm install -g ngrok
   
   # Create tunnel to your localhost
   ngrok http 3000
   
   # Use the provided public URL on any device
   # Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io
   ```

3. **Vercel Preview Deployments**:
   - Push to a feature branch
   - Vercel automatically creates preview deployments
   - Test on mobile using the preview URL

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
- **Touch Interactions**: Voice recording works with touch gestures
- **Audio Permissions**: Mobile browsers may require explicit microphone permission
- **Responsive Design**: UI adapts to mobile screen sizes
- **Voice Cloning**: Works identically on mobile and desktop

## Environment Variables

Below are all environment variables required for this project, with their purpose and visibility:

| Variable Name                  | Public/Private | Purpose                                                      |
|------------------------------- |:-------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL       | Public        | Supabase project URL for browser (frontend)                  |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  | Public        | Supabase anon key for browser (frontend)                     |
| SUPABASE_URL                   | Private       | Supabase project URL for server/API routes                   |
| SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY      | Private       | Supabase service role key for server/API routes              |
| OPENAI_API_KEY                 | Private       | OpenAI API key for LLM summarization (server-side only)      |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY              | Private       | Anthropic Claude API key for LLM summarization (optional)    |
| GOOGLE_API_KEY                 | Private       | Google API key for Gemini, Speech-to-Text, TTS (server-side) |
| HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY            | Private       | HuggingFace API key for emotion analysis (server-side)       |
| ELEVENLABS_API_KEY             | Private       | ElevenLabs API key for TTS (server-side)                     |
| HUME_API_KEY                   | Private       | Hume.ai API key for TTS (server-side, optional)              |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_SECRET       | Public        | Optional: Admin secret for browser admin features            |

**Public variables** (those prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) are exposed to the browser and must not contain sensitive information. All other variables are private and only available to server-side code (API routes, server functions).

**Note:** Vercel and Next.js automatically determine public/private status based on the variable name prefix. No extra configuration is neededâ€”just use the correct naming convention.

## Voice Cloning Feature

### Overview
The app now includes an ElevenLabs-powered voice cloning feature that allows users to create personalized voice clones from their audio recordings. This feature is designed to be simple and user-friendly while maintaining privacy and managing API usage efficiently.

### How It Works
1. **Voice Clone Creation**: Users can clone their voice after recording a reflection by clicking "Clone Voice"
2. **Voice Clone Replacement**: Existing voice clones can be "improved" by replacing them with new audio recordings
3. **Automatic TTS**: Once a voice clone is created, it's automatically used for text-to-speech instead of the default voice
4. **One Clone Per User**: The system maintains only one voice clone per user to prevent API quota accumulation

### Technical Implementation
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/voice-clone` - Creates new voice clones
  - `POST /api/voice-clone/improve` - Replaces existing voice clones with improved versions
  - `DELETE /api/voice-clone/delete` - Removes voice clones
- **ElevenLabs Integration**: Uses instant voice cloning API for immediate use
- **Audio Processing**: Converts WebM audio to the format required by ElevenLabs
- **State Management**: Voice clone IDs are persisted in localStorage and managed in React state

### User Experience
- **Simple Toggle**: Single button to clone/replace voice
- **Immediate Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/failure states
- **Seamless Integration**: Voice clones automatically used for TTS without additional configuration
- **Manual Control**: Users can manually delete voice clones when desired

### Privacy & Security
- Audio recordings are processed by ElevenLabs but not permanently stored
- Voice clone IDs are stored locally and not shared across devices
- No audio data is stored in the app's database

## Global Admin Settings for Summary and TTS

This app uses a global settings table in Supabase to control which summary and TTS (text-to-speech) services are used for all users. These settings are managed by the admin via the UI and API.

### Supabase Table
- **Table:** `global_settings`
- **Fields:**
  - `summary_service` (e.g., 'openai', 'gemini', 'claude')
  - `tts_service` (e.g., 'browser', 'elevenlabs', 'google', 'hume')
  - `elevenlabs_voice_id` (optional, for ElevenLabs TTS)
  - `google_lang` (optional, for Google TTS)
  - `google_gender` (optional, for Google TTS)
  - `hume_voice` (optional, for Hume TTS)
  - `updated_at` (auto-updated timestamp)

### API Route
- **GET `/api/global-settings`**: Returns the current global settings for use by all users.
- **PATCH `/api/global-settings`**: Updates the global settings (admin only; add authentication in production).

### Admin UI
- The admin can update summary and TTS service, ElevenLabs voice, Google TTS language/gender, and Hume voice from the settings tab in the UI.
- All users will use the global settings for a consistent experience.

### Security Note
- The PATCH endpoint should only be accessible to admins. Add authentication/authorization for production use.
