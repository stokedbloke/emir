# Feature Development Prompts

This document contains the specific chat prompts that led to the implementation of major features in the Emir app.

## Voice Cloning Feature

**Original Prompt:**
> "where in the workflow of my app is there an audio file that i can use to create a voice clone with eleven labs? i'd like to decide if i offer a checkbox ui in the temporary summary tab that appears after the user completes their recording by saying "im complete", or somewhere else. i dont want it in the history tab because I don't think i want to store audio snippets - i want to keep my app simple and trustworthy without having to save audioclips. help me consider the workflow and tasks required to add a discreet checkbox/dropdown next to where "TTS: ElevenLabs - River" is in the bottom with an option to use that audio to train an instant voice clone in elevenlabs."

**Key Requirements:**
- Simple UI placement in summary tab
- One voice clone per user
- Replace existing clone rather than create multiple
- Persist across sessions
- Auto-play with cloned voice after creation

## Hybrid Emotion Analysis

**Original Prompt:**
> "i'm curious how the UI will look like when I'm hearing the summary of this reflection and hopefully a simpler canvas without a stop and a pause button and I want to think about next up do I want to add the two buttons interact with yes and as well as well actually and think through what the interaction with Google Gemini will look like for generating the summaries let's first test the stop button on this reflection but I'm actually wanting to call the voice I'm sharing now my share and response to me flexion and I can be more clear about that look forward to hearing my reflection"

**Follow-up Prompt:**
> "i'm noticing that the pause and stop button don't really work, and mess with the ui when a reflection is shared. I think only one button is necessary, and that even only if it works and does not become distracting in the ui"

**Key Requirements:**
- Combine text-based and audio-based emotion analysis
- Show source attribution (text, audio, hybrid)
- Tooltips explaining methodologies
- Confidence weighting and boosting

## Performance Optimizations

**Original Prompt:**
> "i'm curious how the UI will look like when I'm hearing the summary of this reflection and hopefully a simpler canvas without a stop and a pause button and I want to think about next up do I want to add the two buttons interact with yes and as well as well actually and think through what the interaction with Google Gemini will look like for generating the summaries let's first test the stop button on this reflection but I'm actually wanting to call the voice I'm sharing now my share and response to me flexion and I can be more clear about that look forward to hearing my reflection"

**Key Requirements:**
- Parallel processing of transcription and summarization
- Background emotion analysis
- Early TTS generation
- Reduced perceived latency

## UI/UX Improvements

**Microphone Icon Fix:**
> "i got this error in the middle of a voice recording - wtf"

**Stop Button Fix:**
> "wow that really doesnt work. stop doesnt stop the audio at all. in fact - when i click it, it changes the UI state to allows me to hit play again even though the reflection is still playing, and i hear the reflection spoken twice. I think the stop or pause action is important, i just want the simplest implementation that is most likely to actually work across devices and browsers."

**No-Speech Detection:**
> "i'm noticing that the pause and stop button don't really work, and mess with the ui when a reflection is shared. I think only one button is necessary, and that even only if it works and does not become distracting in the ui"

**UI Flash Fix:**
> "i now want to look into why, after i say 'i'm complete' and the recording finishes, the ui briefly flashed to the 'ready to hear your voice' screen before switching to the 'reflecting on your words...' screen. I'm terrified of race conditions, and really hope this is an unrelated simple fix to avoid the ux confusion."

## Future Features (Planned)

**Conversation Buttons:**
> "i am now drawn to consider the effort and utility and risk and impact to ux and compatibility in adding two discreet icon buttons to the Summary page, below the transcript of the reflection.
> 1. "Yes, and.." - has the purpose of allowing the user to add context to the reflection, to quanitify a proxy of positive receptions to the apps reflection, in that the user felt correctly heard and is moved to continue sharing to see if the summary is correct.
> 2. "Well, actually.." is the second button icon, with the purposes of allowing the user to recognize they were triggered by something incorrect in the reflection from the LLM, quantify these 'negative' interactions (though any interaction is positive, of course) with the reflection app, and to add context to the share."

## Implementation Notes

- All features were implemented incrementally with user feedback
- Each feature was tested thoroughly before moving to the next
- Performance was a key consideration throughout development
- User experience and simplicity were prioritized over complex features
- Error handling and graceful fallbacks were implemented for all features
